Mahdi Soleimani successfully defended his MSc thesis on Apr 1st 2016. 

The title of the thesis: "On the Importance of Decoding in Semi-supervised Learning".

The abstract:

In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks a large amount of
unlabelled data is available while labelled data is hard to attain.
Bootstrapping techniques have been shown to be very successful on
a variety of NLP tasks using only a small amount of supervision.
In this research we have studied different bootstrapping techniques
that separate the training step of the algorithm from the decoding
step which produces the argmax label on test data. We then explore
generative models trained in the conventional way using the EM
algorithm but we use an initialization step and a decoding techniques
similar to the Yarowsky bootstrapping algorithm. The new model is
tested on named entity classification and word sense disambiguation
tasks and has shown significant improvement over previous generative
approaches.
