<div class="alert alert-danger">
I am unable to take on any new students for the forseeable future. If you have emailed me about a potential undergraduate or graduate research position (such as Masters or PhD admission) please note that I cannot individually respond to each of you. Stay safe and all the best with your career!
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
Although I try my best to respond to important emails, due the large volume I cannot respond to every email individually. If you do not get a response I hope you have found this page where I try to answer the typical questions you might have about joining or visiting my research lab and admission to graduate studies in computer science at SFU.

## Contacting me

1. If you are a prospective student, postdoc or potential collaborator of any kind please find the appropriate section below that matches your background.
1. After reading this page, if you do contact me please add the code: `X.TcyM6CTZ` to the subject line of your email, e.g. `Subject: Graduate research position in NLP at SFU? (X.TcyM6CTZ). Please do not attach any documents (send a URL instead). I do not guarantee that I will respond if your question can be answered by this web page.
1. If you are in the Greater Vancouver area email me to meet and talk about NLP. You can also show up and attend the [SFU Natural Language Lab](http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca) weekly lab meetings. Visitors are welcome.
1. Useful information:
    * [My research program]({{ site.baseurl }}/research).
    * The [SFU Natural Language Lab](http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca) web page.
    * Information about [my previous students]({{ site.baseurl }}/people).

## Prospective graduate students: Applying for MSc and PhD

If you are considering SFU as a MSc or PhD student in Computer Science, I strongly encourage you to apply. We have an excellent research lab in computational linguistics and natural language processing. We are certainly very competitive with other universities in Canada. 

Please see the notice above for open positions for the following academic year.

**I do not respond to emails** asking for evaluation of your resume for admission. That is why we have an admission process. It is unfortunate that you have to pay an application fee to SFU for my evaluation, but that is normal for university applications around the world. I cannot tell you if you are well suited for my lab without reading your entire graduate application including reference letters.

## International undergraduate students looking for internships

All internship applications usually go through the [MITACS Globalink program](http://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink). I usually have a project available that you can apply for through the Globalink program. Search for my name to find the project description. I am unable to hire any summer interns except through the Globalink program.

Starting in 2019, I have temporarily suspended taking on interns through Globalink.

## SFU undergraduate students

If you are in the undergraduate program at SFU, and you are interested in NLP and working with me, first take the undergraduate NLP course: [CMPT-413: Natural Language Processing](http://anoopsarkar.github.io/nlp-class/). Then if you are interested in doing an internship in my lab, come to one of my lab meetings to see me (see instructions above). Consider applying for the [NSERC USRA program](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/UG-PC/USRA-BRPC_eng.asp) and the [SFU VP Research USRA program](https://www.sfu.ca/dean-gradstudies/awards/undergraduate-awards/undergraduate-research-awards.html). Please do not email me for permission to attend the lab meetings. All are welcome to attend.

## SFU graduate students

If you are already a graduate student at SFU first take the graduate level NLP course: [CMPT 825: Natural Language Processing](http://anoopsarkar.github.io/nlp-class/). Then if you are interested in working with me, come to one of my lab meetings to see me (see instructions above). Please do not email me for permission to attend the lab meetings. All are welcome to attend.

## Prospective postdoctoral fellows

Any currently open postdoc positions will be announced in the [News]({{ site.baseurl }}/news) section. If there is no open postdoc position, I may be unable to reply to your email.
