  <title>cmpt-755: paper grading guideline</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Paper Grading for <a href="index.html">CMPT-755</a></h2>

<p>The page limit is 4 pages and the paper must be written using
LaTeX. Use the style file <a href="colacl06.sty.txt">colacl06.sty</a>
and <a href="acl.bst.txt">acl.bst</a> (note: you will need to rename
the files after you download them). </p>

<p>A sample paper using this style
file and various supporting files (including figures) is provided
in <a href="samplepaper.zip">samplepaper.zip</a> (you do not need
to understand this paper, just look at the way it uses LaTeX,
especially the use of the style file, inclusion of figures, and
other nuances of fitting into a page limit).</p>

<p>The following guidelines should guide you in your paper writing
process. I will look at each of the following points in my grading
(each will get equal weight) to determine the final grade for the
paper. My advice is to write up a draft and then modify it based
on the following points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organization</li>
  <ul>
    <li>what is overall point of the paper</li>
    <li>was the approach and the evaluation or summary clearly presented</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Page limit</li>
  <ul>
    <li>was it within the page limit</li>

    <li>are there adequate examples to explain complex concepts or
algorithms</li>

  </ul>

    <li>hints towards open problems and future work<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
