OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION:

This course covers the fundamentals of compiler theory used to build
compilers for high level programming languages.  Algorithms used in
building a compiler and their underlying theoretical foundations will be
covered.  We will cover each component of a compiler including lexical
analysis, parsing, code generation, code optimization and type checking.
Working in small teams, students will also implement a working compiler for
a high level programming language.

TOPICS:

   o Overview of a compiler
   o Lexical Analysis:  formal language theory:  regular expressions and
     finite-state machines, scanners, symbol tables
   o Simple Parsing:  context-free grammars, derivation trees, ambiguity,
     sentential forms, backtracking parsers, top-down versus bottom-up
     parsing
   o LL(1) parsing:  removing left-recursion, left-factoring, error
     handling
   o Shift-reduce parsers:  handles and handle pruning, shift/reduce
     conflicts
   o SLR/LR parsing:  characteristic automata, action and goto functions,
     viable prefix, introduction to LALR parsing
   o Type checking:  typing rules, unification, types as inferencing rules,
     attribute grammars
   o Semantics and code generation:  generating code from attribute
     grammars, flow of control, handling memory, garbage collection,
     generating code for conditionals, arrays, and procedures
   o Optimization:  peephole optimization, redundant instruction
     elimination, dataflow analysis and global optimization (an
     introduction)

GRADING:

The grade distribution will be handed out at the start of classes.

Academic Honesty plays a key role in our efforts to maintain a high
standard of academic excellence and integrity.  Students are advised that
ALL acts of intellectual dishonesty are subject to disciplinary action by
the School; serious infractions are dealt with in accordance with the Code
of Academic Honesty (T10.02)
(http://www.sfu.ca/policies/teaching/t10-02.htm).  Students are encouraged
to read the School's Statement on Intellectual Honesty
(http://www.cs.sfu.ca/undergrad/Policies/honesty.html).
