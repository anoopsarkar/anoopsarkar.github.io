<h3>Final Paper Topics for CMPT-755</h3>
One of these topics can be a valid paper topic for this course. If you
have
your own topic that you wish to pursue (this is encouraged!), please
provide a one-page written proposal to me and I will discuss it with
you. Topics can be either the theoretical analysis of some technique
useful for compilers or an implementation and comparison between
alternate methods. Implementations can use existing tools available on
the web.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Implement and test 2 different edit-distance based syntax error
correction algorithms: either 2 different CFG algorithms or compare
regular languages and CFL-based algorithms.</li>
  <li>Provide a theoretical analysis or an implementation of code
generation from parse trees using tree matching by exploiting the
notion of tree transducers.</li>

  </ul>
  <li>Invent a new algorithm or analyze an existing algorithm that
takes a set of input strings and produces the smallest CFG that
generates exactly this set. One idea is to use block edit distance to
improve on current smallest grammar algorithms.</li>

    <li>Also cf. references in above thesis.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Provide an algorithm which takes as input a parse tree and a
deterministic CFG and enumerates all the input strings that when parsed
with the CFG will result in the parse tree. Such an algorithm has
important applications in designing sequences that lead to a particular
structure in the fields of computational linguistics and biological
sequence analysis.</li>
  <li>Review existing Monte Carlo and Las Vegas randomized algorithms
for recognition of regular and context-free languages. Can we use a
Monte Carlo algorithm that uses regular language recognition algorithms
and uses it for context-free recognition, or similarly uses
context-free algorithms for context-sensitive recognition?<br>
  </li>
  <li>We know the answer to the question: is there an algorithm which
can decide if a particular language represented by a CFG in the set of
regular language. This is possible when the CFG is equivalent to a
deterministic PDA. As far as I know it does not hold for arbitrary CFGs
(due to emptiness?). It is known that there is a doubly exponential
upper and lower bound to this algorithm. Can this algorithm be extended
to other sub-classes of CFGs, e.g. regular closures over deterministic
CFGs.</li>

  <li>If we have G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> and they are both
regular grammars then it easy to show if L(G<sub>1</sub>) = L(G<sub>2</sub>).
The following result extends this for the languages generated by two
deterministic pushdown automata. A review of this result would be
acceptable as a final paper.<br>
