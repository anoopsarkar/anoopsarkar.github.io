We propose a new general-purpose prediction action which predicts future words in the input to improve quality and minimize delay in simultaneous translation. We train this agent using reinforcement learning with a novel reward function. Our agent with prediction has better translation quality and less delay compared to an agent-based simultaneous translation system without prediction.}

  abstract = {The addition of syntax-aware decoding in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems requires an effective tree-structured neural network, a syntax-aware attention model and a language generation model that is sensitive to sentence structure. We exploit a top-down tree-structured model called DRNN (Doubly-Recurrent Neural Networks) first proposed by Alvarez-Melis and Jaakola (2017) to create an NMT model called Seq2DRNN that combines a sequential encoder with tree-structured decoding augmented with a syntax-aware attention model. Unlike previous approaches to syntax-based NMT which use dependency parsing models our method uses constituency parsing which we argue provides useful information for translation. In addition, we use the syntactic structure of the sentence to add new connections to the tree-structured decoder neural network (Seq2DRNN+SynC). We compare our NMT model with sequential and state of the art syntax-based NMT models and show that our model produces more fluent translations with better reordering. Since our model is capable of doing translation and constituency parsing at the same time we also compare our parsing accuracy against other neural parsing models.}

That, along with a push for automated evaluation of clinical reports, present opportunities for effective natural language processing methods. In this study we target the problem of named entity recognition, where texts are processed to annotate terms that are relevant for biomedical studies. Terms of interest in the domain include gene and protein names, and cell lines and types. Here we report on a pipeline built on Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) and a deep learning package for natural language processing (AllenNLP). We trained context-aware token embeddings on a dataset of biomedical papers using ELMo, and incorporated these embeddings in the LSTM-CRF model used by AllenNLP for named entity recognition. We show these representations improve named entity recognition for different types of biomedical named entities. We also achieve a new state of the art in gene mention detection on the BioCreative II gene mention shared task.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel analysis of clausal coordination with shared arguments using synchronous tree adjoining grammar (STAG), a pairing of a tree adjoining grammar (TAG) for syntax and a TAG for semantics. In clausal coordination, one or more arguments can be shared by the verbal predicates of the conjuncts, as in Sue likes and Kim hates Pete, where an object argument Pete is shared by likes and hates. As the predicate-argument structure must be represented within each predicative elementary tree in TAG, modelling argument sharing across clauses poses an interesting challenge for TAG. A widely adopted approach within the TAG literature at present is to employ the conjoin operation (Sakar and Joshi, 1996, Proceedings of COLING ’96, 610–615), a non-standard tree-composing operation in TAG. This operation applies across elementary trees to identify and merge the arguments from each clause, yielding a derivation structure in which the shared arguments are combined with multiple elementary trees and a derived tree in which the shared arguments are dominated by multiple verbal projections. In contrast, our STAG analysis pairs a syntactic elementary tree that participates in the derivation of clausal coordination with a semantic elementary tree that includes a λ-term to abstract over the shared argument. This allows the sharing of arguments in coordination to be instantiated in semantics, without being represented in syntax in the form of multiple dominance, utilizing only the standard TAG operations, substitution and adjoining.}

In this paper, we present the results of a user study on how these features are used in each of Vakkari's stages of information seeking (pre-focus, focus formulation, and post-focus), and the participants perceptions of the utility of these features to their overall information-seeking goals. Participants primarily used the input and control features during the pre-focus stage, the informational features during the focus formulation stage, and the personalization features during the post-focus stage. We also found differences between the assigned search activities and those chosen by the participants. Findings from this study contribute to understanding how people use advanced search, summarization, and visualization tools to aid their information seeking tasks.}}

In this work, we provide a new algorithm, using Pareto-optimality, for finding good segment boundaries that can balance the trade-off between latency versus translation quality. We compare against the state-of-the-art greedy algorithm from (Oda et al. 2014). Our experimental results show that we can improve latency by up to 12\% without harming the Bleu score for the same average segment length. Another benefit is that for any segment size, Pareto-optimal segments maximize latency and translation quality.}}

We propose a novel approach, ensemble decoding, which combines a number of translation systems dynamically at the decoding step. In this paper, we evaluate performance on a domain adaptation setting where we translate sentences from the medical domain. Our experimental results show that ensemble decoding outperforms various strong baselines including mixture models, the current state-of-the-art for domain adaptation in machine translation.}

  abstract = {This paper describes Kriya --- a new statistical machine translation (SMT) system that uses hierarchical phrases, which were first introduced in the Hiero machine translation system (Chiang 2007). Kriya supports both a grammar extraction module for synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) and a CKY-based decoder. There are several re-implementations of Hiero in the machine translation community, but Kriya offers the following novel contributions: (a) Grammar extraction in Kriya supports extraction of the full set of Hiero-style SCFG rules but also supports the extraction of several types of compact rule sets which leads to faster decoding for different language pairs without compromising the BLEU scores. Kriya currently supports extraction of compact SCFGs such as grammars with one non-terminal and grammar pruning based on certain rule patterns, and (b) The Kriya decoder offers some unique improvements in the implementation of cube pruning, such as increasing diversity in the target language n-best output and novel methods for language model (LM) integration. The Kriya decoder can take advantage of parallelization using a networked cluster.  Kriya supports KENLM and SRILM for language model queries and exploits n-gram history states in KENLM. This paper also provides several experimental results which demonstrate that the translation quality of Kriya compares favourably to the Moses (Koehn 2007) phrase-based system in several language pairs while showing a substantial improvement for Chinese-English similar to (Chiang 2007). We also quantify the model sizes for phrase-based and Hiero-style systems apart from presenting experiments comparing variants of Hiero models.}

However, Shallow-n grammars require parameters which cannot be directly optimized using minimum error-rate tuning by the decoder. This paper introduces some novel improvements to the translation model for Shallow-n grammars. We introduce two rules: a BITG-style reordering glue rule and a simpler monotonic concatenation rule. We use separate features for the new rules in our log-linear model allowing the decoder to directly optimize the feature weights. We show this formulation of Shallow-n hierarchical phrase-based translation is comparable in translation quality to full Hiero-style decoding (without shallow rules) while at the same time being considerably faster.}

  abstract = {Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is currently used in real-time and commercial settings to quickly produce initial translations for a document which can later be edited by a human. The SMT models specialized for one domain often perform poorly when applied to other domains. The typical assumption that both training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution no longer applies. This paper evaluates domain adaptation techniques for SMT systems in the context of end-user feedback in a real world application. We present our experiments using two adaptive techniques, one relying on log-linear models and the other using mixture models. We describe our experimental results on legal and government data, and present the human evaluation effort for post-editing in addition to traditional automated scoring techniques (BLEU scores). The human effort is based primarily on the amount of time and number of edits required by a professional post-editor to improve the quality of machine-generated translations to meet industry standards. The experimental results in this paper show that the domain adaptation techniques can yield a significant increase in BLEU score (up to four points) and a significant reduction in post-editing time of about one second per word.}

We implemented a distributed perceptron training algorithm in a MapReduce framework for a structured output chunking task and evaluated it on a cluster and on multi-core systems. Our work extends (McDonald et al. 2002) into two areas of analysis. We compare two methods for implementing the algorithm and find that the choice of topology in the MapReduce operations significantly affects runtime, with the unexpected result that duplicating computation increases overall performance. We also examine the behaviour with different numbers of data shards and find a tradeoff between runtime and accuracy.}

Our approach is designed to extract rules that are licensed by the word alignments and heuristically extracted phrase pairs. Our Bayesian model limits the number of SCFG rules extracted, by sampling from the space of all possible hierarchical rules; additionally our informed prior based on the lexical alignment probabilities biases the grammar to extract high quality rules leading to improved generalization and the automatic identification of commonly re-used rules. We show that our Bayesian model is able to extract minimal set of hierarchical phrase rules without impacting the translation quality as measured by the BLEU score.}

Our methods use unsupervised morphology induction. Unlike previous work we focus on morphologically productive phrase pairs – our decoder can combine morphemes across phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the target language may not have a corresponding morpheme or word in the source language. Therefore, we propose a novel combination of post-processing morphology prediction with morpheme-based translation. We show, using both automatic evaluation scores and linguistically motivated analyses of the output, that our methods outperform previously proposed ones and provide the best known results on the EnglishFinnish Europarl translation task. Our methods are mostly language independent, so they should improve translation into other target languages with complex morphology.},
