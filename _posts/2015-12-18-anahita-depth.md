title: "Anahita passes her PhD depth exam"
---

Anahita Mansouri successfully defended her PhD thesis on Dec 18th 2015. 

The title of her survey paper was: "Word alignment for Statistical Machine Translation using Hidden Markov Models".

## Abstract

> Statistical machine translation (SMT) relies on large parallel data
> between source and target languages. Word alignment is a crucial
> early step in training of most SMT systems. The objective of the
> word alignment task is to discover the word-to-word correspondences
> in a sentence pair. The classic IBM Models 1-5 and the Hidden Markov
> Model (HMM) have underpinned the majority of the SMT systems to
> date.
 
> HMMs have been applied to numerous problems in NLP. The key attraction
> of HMMs is the existence of well-known tractable algorithms for EM
> parameter estimation (Baum- Welch algorithm) and maximization
> (Viterbi algorithm). HMMs have been exploited for the word alignment
> problem. The performance of an improved HMM word alignment model
> is comparable to that of IBM Model 4 which is arguably the most
> widely used model for word alignment. Compared to IBM Model 4, HMM
> is much easier to implement and modify and is more time-efficient
> to train. This report is a summary of the key papers that use the
> HMM-based word alignment model for SMT.
