Title: Improving Statistical Machine Translation with a Multilingual Paraphrase Database

Authors: Ramtin Mehdizadeh Seraj; Maryam Siahbani; Anoop Sarkar

Abstract: 

The multilingual Paraphrase Database (PPDB) is a freely available
automatically created resource of paraphrases in multiple languages.
In statistical machine translation, paraphrases can be used to
provide translation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) phrases. In this
paper, we show that a graph propagation approach that uses PPDB
paraphrases can be used to improve overall translation quality. We
provide an extensive comparison with previous work and show that
our PPDB-based method improves the BLEU score by up to 1.79 percent
points. We show that our approach improves on the state of the art
in three different settings: when faced with limited amount of
parallel training data; a domain shift between training and test
data; and handling a morphologically complex source language. Our
PPDB-based method outperforms the use of distributional profiles
from monolingual source data.
