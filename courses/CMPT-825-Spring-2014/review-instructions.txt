CMPT 825 Review Form - Instructions
========================================================================

Please complete your review using the following guidelines for the 
scored categories.

APPROPRIATENESS (1-5)
---------------------

Does the paper fit in ACL 2014? (Please answer this question in light of
the desire to broaden the scope of the research areas represented at ACL.)

5: Certainly.
4: Probably.
3: Unsure.
2: Probably not.
1: Certainly not.

CLARITY (1-5)
-------------

For the reasonably well-prepared reader, is it clear what was done and why?
Is the paper well-written and well-structured?

5 = Very clear.
4 = Understandable by most readers.
3 = Mostly understandable to me with some effort.
2 = Important questions were hard to resolve even with effort.
1 = Much of the paper is confusing.

ORIGINALITY (1-5)
-----------------

How original is the approach? Does this paper break new ground in topic,
methodology, or content? How exciting and innovative is the research it
describes?
Note that a paper could score high for originality even if the results do
not show a convincing benefit.

5 = Surprising: Significant new problem, technique, methodology, or insight
-- no prior research has attempted something similar.
4 = Creative: An intriguing problem, technique, or approach that is
substantially different from previous research.
3 = Respectable: A nice research contribution that represents a notable
extension of prior approaches or methodologies.
2 = Pedestrian: Obvious, or a minor improvement on familiar techniques.
1 = Significant portions have actually been done before or done better.

IMPLEMENTATION AND SOUNDNESS
(1-5)
----------------------------------

Has the application or tool been fully implemented or do certain parts of
the system remain to be implemented? Does it achieve its claims? Is enough
detail provided that one might be able to replicate the application or tool
with some effort? Are working examples provided and do they adequately
illustrate the claims made?

5 = The application or tool is fully implemented, and the claims are
convincingly supported. Other researchers should be able to replicate the
work.
4 = Generally solid work, although there are some aspects of the
application or tool that still need work, and/or some claims that should be
better illustrated and supported.
3 = Fairly reasonable work. The main claims are illustrated to some extent
with examples, but I am not entirely ready to accept that the application
or tool can do everything that it should (based on the material in the
paper).
2 = Troublesome. There are some aspects that might be good, but the
application or tool has several deficiencies and/or limitations that make
it premature.
1 = Fatally flawed.

SUBSTANCE (1-5)
---------------

Does this paper have enough substance, or would it benefit from more ideas
or results?
Note that this question mainly concerns the amount of work; its quality is
evaluated in other categories.

5 = Contains more ideas or results than most publications in this
conference; goes the extra mile.
4 = Represents an appropriate amount of work for a publication in this
conference. (most submissions)
3 = Leaves open one or two natural questions that should have been pursued
within the paper.
2 = Work in progress. There are enough good ideas, but perhaps not enough
in terms of outcome.
1 = Seems thin. Not enough ideas here for a full-length paper.

EVALUATION (1-5)
----------------

To what extent has the application or tool been tested and evaluated? Have
there been any user studies?

5 = The application or tool has been thoroughly tested. Rigorous evaluation
on a large corpus or via formal user studies support the claims made for
the system. Critical analysis of the results yields many insights into the
limitations (if any).
4 = The application or tool has been tested and evaluated on a reasonable
corpus or with a small set of users. The results support the claims made.
Critical analysis of the results yields some insights into the limitations
(if any).
3 = The application or tool has been tested and evaluated to a limited
extent. The results have been critically analyzed to gain insight into the
system's performance.
2 = A few test cases have been run on the application or tool but no
significant evaluation or user study has been performed.
1 = The application or tool has not been tested or evaluated.

MEANINGFUL COMPARISON (1-5)
---------------------------

Do the authors make clear where the problems and methods sit with respect
to existing literature? Are the references adequate? For empirical papers,
are the experimental results meaningfully compared with the best prior
approaches?

5 = Precise and complete comparison with related work. Good job given the
space constraints.
4 = Mostly solid bibliography and comparison, but there are some references
missing.
3 = Bibliography and comparison are somewhat helpful, but it could be hard
for a reader to determine exactly how this work relates to previous work.
2 = Only partial awareness and understanding of related work, or a flawed
empirical comparison.
1 = Little awareness of related work, or lacks necessary empirical
comparison.

OVERALL SCORE (1-40)
--------------------

The overall score combines all the above scores but also includes
an additional 5 points that will be used to rank projects based
on their unique characteristics.
