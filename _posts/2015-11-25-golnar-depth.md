Golnar Sheikhshab successfully defended her PhD thesis on Nov 25th 2015. 

The title of her survey paper was: "Graph-based semi-supervised learning".

## Abstract

> Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) is based on the assumption
> that similar data points should have similar labels. A graph is
> constructed whose vertices represent data points and whose edge-weights
> represent how strongly we believe the adjacent vertices (data points)
> should get the same label. The graph will connect labeled and
> unlabeled data points and each vertex is associated with a label
> distribution that represents the current belief about its label.
> Having this graph that encodes the similarities between data points,
> the goal is to find label distributions for all vertices so that
> 1) for any labeled vertex v, the associated label distribution is
> as close as possible to its reference distribution obtained from
> the labeled data based on the number of times each data (point,
> label) pair appeared together; 2) adjacent vertices in the graph
> have similar label distributions; 3) the label distributions of all
> vertices comply with the prior knowledge if such knowledge exists.
> This report is a summary of a few papers that represent the state
> of the art in graph propagation for semi-supervised machine learning
> applied to various NLP tasks.
