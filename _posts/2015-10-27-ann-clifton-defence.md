Ann Clifton successfully defended her PhD thesis on Oct 27th 2015. 

The title of her thesis: "Discriminative Learning Over Latent Structures for Natural Language Processing".

Here is the abstract of her thesis:

Natural language is rich with layers of implicit structure, and
previous research has shown that we can take advantage of this
structure to make more accurate models. Most attempts to utilize
forms of implicit natural language structure for natural language
processing tasks have assumed a pre-defined structural analysis
before training the task-specific model. However, rather than fixing
the latent structure, we may wish to discover the latent structure
that is most useful via feedback from an extrinsic task. The focus
of this work is on jointly learning the best latent analysis along
with the model for the NLP task we are interested in.  In this work,
we present a generalized learning framework for discriminative
training over jointly learned latent structures, and apply this to
several NLP tasks. We develop a high-accuracy discriminative language
model over shallow parse structures; in addition, we set forth a
framework for latent structure learning for machine translation,
in which the latent segmentation and alignment of the parallel
training data inform the translation model.
