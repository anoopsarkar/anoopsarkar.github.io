<h2>Paper Grading for <a href="index.html">CMPT-755</a></h2>
<p>The following guidelines should guide you in your paper writing
process. These points will appear in the review forms that will be
handed out to you after the first submission. I will look at each of
these points in my grading (in no particular order) to inform the final
grade for the paper. My advice is to write up a draft and then modify
it based on the following points.<br>
