OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the automatic analysis of human
language by computer algorithms.  These algorithms can be used to convert
unstructured data such as transcribed speech or large text collections
(like the web) into structured forms.  NLP algorithms allow us to take
abstract information embedded in language and produce informative labels
(e.g.  identifying a sequence of words as the name of a protein or a
company name) using very little specialized information.  The course will
be mainly covering statistical machine learning methods for NLP. (This
course will be in Area 3).

TOPICS:

   o Language models and smoothed estimation
   o Statistical machine translation
   o The EM algorithm
   o Stochastic parsing and tagging; Log-linear models
   o Re-ranking methods for parsing and tagging
   o Kernel methods
   o Finite-state and tree transducers

GRADING:

Midterm (20%), Final Paper (30%), Final Project (30%), Class Presentation
(20%).

Students must attain an overall passing grade on the weighted average of
exams in the course in order to obtain a clear pass (C or better).
