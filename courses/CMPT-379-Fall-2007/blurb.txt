CMPT-379, an introduction to compilers, is being offered in Fall
2007. If you want to learn how to design and implement your own
programming language, then consider taking this course. A compiler
enables us to use a high-level programming language like C or Java
by translating such programs into low-level machine code.  Understanding
how compilers work is essential if you want to be a good programmer.

I am sending this message to highlight some new changes to this
course which will take effect in the Fall 2007 offering. These
changes should make this course more appealing to students interested
in programming languages.

First, we are changing the textbook to the new edition (the "purple
dragon book"):

Compilers:  Principles, Techniques and Tools (2nd Edition), A. V.
Aho, M. S. Lam, R. Sethi, and J. D. Ullman, Addison-Wesley, 2006:

The textbook is augmented with my own detailed lecture notes.

Second, the assignments are going to be updated as well and we will
use popular open-source tools for building compilers. In the past,
this course had a reputation of having time-consuming programming
assignments, but I have developed a new sequence of assignments to
streamline this process.

Students lacking the MACM 201 pre-requisite should contact me. I
am also happy to answer any other questions.
