The topics for quiz #1 will be Topics 1, 2 and 3 under the Syllabus
section on the course web page.

Ignore the discussion on syntax-directed translation in Chapter 2 of
the textbook.

Here are some pointers to examples and questions from the textbook
that you can work through. If you post solutions to the mailing
list, either the TA or I will comment on them. 

The following examples and questions are only a minimal set intended
as a guide for what you can use to prepare for the quiz.

Ex 2.1 on page 78 

 - Be careful to distinguish the * in the string from the * closure
   operation in a regular expression

 - In this question, it says "justify your answer" which means you
   have to provide a proof of the kind given in `Notes #3' on the
   course web page. But if it doesn't ask for a justification, you
   don't need to provide such a proof.
