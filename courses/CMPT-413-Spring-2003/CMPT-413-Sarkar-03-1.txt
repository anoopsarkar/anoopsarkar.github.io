OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION:

Computational Linguistics is the study of human language from a
computational perspective.  This course will examine algorithms used in the
automatic analysis or production of language.  Along with formal models of
language, we will also study the engineering of natural language processing
software.  Many of the concepts, methods and algorithms studied are related
to topics like formal linguistics, information retrieval, data mining from
text, and bioinformatics.  The course will also provide an introduction to
programming with Perl.  Assignments will develop expertise in Perl and
provide exposure to commonly used datasets.

TOPICS:

   o Introduction to linguistics and formal language theory
   o Finite-state transducers:  application to word morphology
   o Introduction to probability and information theory
   o Edit distances for spelling correction and phylogeny
   o Speech recognition:  hidden markov models
   o Search engines and document classification
   o Word classes and part of speech tagging
   o Context-free and tree-adjoining grammars
   o Feature structures and unification
   o Machine translation
   o Semantics, lexical semantics and Wordnet
   o Word-sense disambiguation
   o Discourse and dialog models

GRADING:

Assignments (40%), Midterm (20%), Final Examination (40%).

Students must attain an overall passing grade on the weighted average of
exams in the course in order to obtain a clear pass (C or better).
