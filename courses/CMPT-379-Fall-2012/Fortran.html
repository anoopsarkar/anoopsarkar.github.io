<h1>Historical Perspective: FORTRAN I<br>
</h1>
<p>The first version of FORTRAN violates many notions of good
programming language (PL) design. Here are some highlights:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Variables can be upto 5 chars long and must begin with a letter.
Variables beginning with i, j, k, l, m and n are assumed to be integer
types. Some PL experts say this is why the letters i and j are so
popular even now as loop variable names.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Variable declarations are not required, except for arrays.&nbsp;
Arrays are limited to 3 dimensions. <br>
  </li>
  <li>The control structures consisted of: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>unconditional branch: GOTO statement_number <br>
    </li>
    <li>conditional branch: <code>GOTO (30, 40, 50) I1</code> where <code>I1</code>
has a value of 1, 2 or 3 to indicate which position in the list to jump
to.</li>
    <li>IF statement: <code>IF (A+B-1.2) 7, 6, 9</code> transfers
control to statement labeled 7, 6, or 9&nbsp; depending on whether <code>(A+B-1.2)</code>
is negative, zero or positive.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>DO statement: <code>DO 17 I = 1, N, 2</code> which specifies
that the set of statements following, up to and including that labeled
17, is to be executed with I first assigned value 1,&nbsp; incrementing
by 2, up through N.&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>No user-defined subroutines allowed, although several built-ins
were provided including&nbsp; <code>READ</code> and <code>WRITE</code>
for I/O. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Blanks are ignored in all statements, e.g., all the following are
equivalent: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>DIMENSION IN DATA(10000)&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>DIMENSIONINDATA(10000)&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
    <li>D I M E N S I O N I N D A T A ( 1 0 0 0 0 )&nbsp; <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Whitespace was relevant in other cases: Code started on a
particular column number.</li>
  <li>Reserved words are valid variable names, e.g., <code>DIMENSION
IF(100) </code>declares an array called IF.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>FORTRAN had two basic stages in compiling:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation in one big loop
and switch program.</li>
    <li>The other stages of the compiler were dealing with code
optimization steps.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
