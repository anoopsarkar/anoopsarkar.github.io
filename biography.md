Anoop Sarkar is Professor of Computer Science at [Simon Fraser
University](http://www.sfu.ca) in British Columbia, Canada where
he co-directs the [Natural Language Laboratory](http://natlang.cs.sfu.ca).

Anoop Sarkar is interested in developing machine learning methods
for natural language processing. He has published on statistical
machine translation for human languages, and the summarization of
information in language using a combination of visualization and
semantic parsing algorithms. He sometimes dreams about automated
computational decipherment of ancient scripts and mysterious
manuscripts.

Anoop Sarkar is the recipient of a 2013 NSERC Discovery Accelerator
Supplement award, a 2014 and 2009 Google Faculty Award, 2008 IBM
Faculty Award and a 2012 NSERC Collaborative Research and Development
Grant with industrial contributions from Boeing and AeroInfo Systems.
He received the Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching Award in 2007
by the SFU Undergraduate Computing Science Student Society (CSSS).

Anoop Sarkar received his PhD from the Department of Computer and
Information Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania under Prof.
Aravind Joshi for his work on semi-supervised statistical parsing
using Tree-Adjoining Grammars. Based on this background, he continues
to be interested in formal-language theory (finite-state transducers,
tree automata and stochastic formal grammars).
