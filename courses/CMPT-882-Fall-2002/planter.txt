The purpose of this assignment was to find concordance structures for a
given word (e.g. plant).

The Planter program (a command-line program), created in Sicstus
Prolog, produces such concordance structures.  The user can specify the
word of interest and the number of context words desired before and
after.  The word of interest must be provided with its tag in the case
of the data sets provided by Prof. Sarkar: e.g. plant_nn.

To run Planter, start Sicstus Prolog in a terminal window and load Planter:

?-[planter].

Then enter:

?-planter(Word,Num).

...where Word is the word of interest, for example 'plant_nn', and Num is 
the number of context words, for example '3'.
