OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION:

This is an Area 3 course covering some advanced topics in Artificial
Intelligence.  The course will cover some topics in machine learning.  We
will focus on learning which assumes that the training data is generated
from some stochastic source, but otherwise makes no assumption about any
particular distribution having generated the data.  These are so-called
"distribution-free" or discriminative methods.  In addition, the course
will focus on the analysis of the algorithms used in different learning
models, and explore the trade-off between optimal learning vs.  scalability
of the learning model to large datasets.  Additional topics that are
related to student projects for this course will also be covered.

TOPICS:

   o Linear classification
   o Support Vector Machines
   o Boosting
   o Perceptron variants
   o Global linear models
   o Markov Random Fields
   o Kernel methods
   o Discriminative learning for structured labels
   o Discriminative methods in semi-supervised learning

GRADING:

Class participation (20%), class presentation (40%), Project and research
report (40%).  The project will be either a group or an individual project.



TEXTBOOKS:

   o None.  (handouts, conference and journal papers will be distributed in
     class), , ,

PREREQUISITES/COREQUISITES:

Some exposure to elementary statistics, probability theory and numerical
methods is needed.

Academic Honesty plays a key role in our efforts to maintain a high
standard of academic excellence and integrity.  Students are advised that
ALL acts of intellectual dishonesty are subject to disciplinary action by
the School; serious infractions are dealt with in accordance with the Code
of Academic Honesty (T10.02)
(http://www.sfu.ca/policies/teaching/t10-02.htm).  Students are encouraged
