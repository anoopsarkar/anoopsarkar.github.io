  abstract  = {{The multilingual Paraphrase Database (PPDB) is a freely available automatically created resource of paraphrases in multiple languages. In statistical machine translation, paraphrases can be used to provide translation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) phrases. In this paper, we show that a graph propagation approach that uses PPDB paraphrases can be used to improve overall translation quality. We provide an extensive comparison with previous work and show that our PPDB-based method improves the BLEU score by up to 1.79 percent points. We show that our approach improves on the state of the art in three different settings: when faced with limited amount of parallel training data; a domain shift between training and test data; and handling a morphologically complex source language. Our PPDB-based method outperforms the use of distributional profiles from monolingual source data.}}

Improvements in dependency parsing can help improve machine translation and information extraction applications among many others. In this thesis, we extend the framework of (Koo, Carreras, and Collins, 2008) for dependency parsing which uses a single clustering method for semi-supervised learning. We make use of multiple diverse clustering methods to build multiple discriminative dependency parsing models in the Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) parsing framework (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira, 2005). All of these diverse clustering-based parsers are then combined together using a novel ensemble model, which performs exact inference on the shared hypothesis space of all the parser models. We show that diverse clustering-based parser models and the ensemble method together significantly improves unlabeled dependency accuracy from 90.82% to 92.46% on Section 23 of the Penn Treebank. We also show significant improvements in domain adaptation to the Switchboard and Brown corpora.},

Kriya supports both a grammar extraction module for synchronous context-free grammars (SCFGs) and a CKY-based decoder. There are several re-implementations of Hiero in the machine translation community, but Kriya offers the following novel contributions: (a) Grammar extraction in Kriya supports extraction of the full set of Hiero-style SCFG rules but also supports the extraction of several types of compact rule sets which leads to faster decoding for different language pairs without compromising the BLEU scores. Kriya currently supports extraction of compact SCFGs such as grammars with one non-terminal and grammar pruning based on certain rule patterns, and (b) The Kriya decoder offers some unique improvements in the implementation of cube pruning, such as increasing diversity in the target language n-best output and novel methods for language model (LM) integration. The Kriya decoder can take advantage of parallelization using a networked cluster.  Kriya supports KENLM and SRILM for language model queries and exploits n-gram history states in KENLM. This paper also provides several experimental results which demonstrate that the translation quality of Kriya compares favourably to the Moses (Koehn 2007) phrase-based system in several language pairs while showing a substantial improvement for Chinese-English similar to (Chiang 2007). We also quantify the model sizes for phrase-based and Hiero-style systems apart from presenting experiments comparing variants of Hiero models.}

However, Shallow-n grammars require parameters which cannot be directly optimized using minimum error-rate tuning by the decoder. This paper introduces some novel improvements to the translation model for Shallow-n grammars. We introduce two rules: a BITG-style reordering glue rule and a simpler monotonic concatenation rule. We use separate features for the new rules in our log-linear model allowing the decoder to directly optimize the feature weights. We show this formulation of Shallow-n hierarchical phrase-based translation is comparable in translation quality to full Hiero-style decoding (without shallow rules) while at the same time being considerably faster.}

The SMT models specialized for one domain often perform poorly when applied to other domains. The typical assumption that both training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution no longer applies. This paper evaluates domain adaptation techniques for SMT systems in the context of end-user feedback in a real world application. We present our experiments using two adaptive techniques, one relying on log-linear models and the other using mixture models. We describe our experimental results on legal and government data, and present the human evaluation effort for post-editing in addition to traditional automated scoring techniques (BLEU scores). The human effort is based primarily on the amount of time and number of edits required by a professional post-editor to improve the quality of machine-generated translations to meet industry standards. The experimental results in this paper show that the domain adaptation techniques can yield a significant increase in BLEU score (up to four points) and a significant reduction in post-editing time of about one second per word.}

We compare two methods for implementing the algorithm and find that the choice of topology in the MapReduce operations significantly affects runtime, with the unexpected result that duplicating computation increases overall performance. We also examine the behaviour with different numbers of data shards and find a tradeoff between runtime and accuracy.}

Our approach is designed to extract rules that are licensed by the word alignments and heuristically extracted phrase pairs. Our Bayesian model limits the number of SCFG rules extracted, by sampling from the space of all possible hierarchical rules; additionally our informed prior based on the lexical alignment probabilities biases the grammar to extract high quality rules leading to improved generalization and the automatic identification of commonly re-used rules. We show that our Bayesian model is able to extract minimal set of hierarchical phrase rules without impacting the translation quality as measured by the BLEU score.}

Our methods use unsupervised morphology induction. Unlike previous work we focus on morphologically productive phrase pairs – our decoder can combine morphemes across phrase boundaries. Morphemes in the target language may not have a corresponding morpheme or word in the source language. Therefore, we propose a novel combination of post-processing morphology prediction with morpheme-based translation. We show, using both automatic evaluation scores and linguistically motivated analyses of the output, that our methods outperform previously proposed ones and provide the best known results on the EnglishFinnish Europarl translation task. Our methods are mostly language independent, so they should improve translation into other target languages with complex morphology.},

  abstract = {In this paper we focus on the incremental decoding for a statistical phrase-based machine translation system. In incremental decoding, translations are generated incrementally for every word typed by a user, instead of waiting for the entire sentence as input. We introduce a novel modification to the beam-search decoding algorithm for phrase-based MT to address this issue, aimed at efficient computation of future costs and avoiding search errors. Our objective is to do a faster translation during incremental decoding without significant reduction in the translation quality.},
