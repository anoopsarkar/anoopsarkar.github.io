OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION:

Computational Linguistics is the study of human language from a
computational perspective.  This course will examine algorithms used in the
automatic analysis of language, machine translation or language generation.
Along with formal models of language, we will also study the engineering of
natural language processing software.  Many of the concepts, methods and
algorithms studied are related to topics like formal linguistics,
information retrieval, data mining from text, and biological sequence
analysis.

TOPICS:

   o Finite-state methods:  automata and transducers
   o Applications of finite-state methods (orthography, morphology and
     phonology)
   o Probability models and language
   o Machine translation
   o Hidden markov models:  sequence learning
   o Applications of sequence learning (speech recognition, tagging,
     information extraction)
   o Context-free grammars and parsing algorithms (natural language syntax
     and semantics)
   o Lexical semantics and word-sense disambiguation
   o Feature structures and unification
   o Dealing with multiple sentences:  Discourse and dialog models
   o Summarization of Text
   o Natural language and computational complexity

GRADING:

Assignments (34%), Quiz x 3 (36%), Final Examination (30%).

Students must attain an overall passing grade on the weighted average of
exams in the course in order to obtain a clear pass (C- or better).

TEXTBOOKS:

   o None

Academic Honesty plays a key role in our efforts to maintain a high
standard of academic excellence and integrity.  Students are advised that
ALL acts of intellectual dishonesty are subject to disciplinary action by
the School; serious infractions are dealt with in accordance with the Code
of Academic Honesty (T10.02)
(http://www.sfu.ca/policies/teaching/t10-02.htm).  Students are encouraged
to read the School's Statement on Intellectual Honesty
(http://www.cs.sfu.ca/undergrad/Policies/honesty.html).
