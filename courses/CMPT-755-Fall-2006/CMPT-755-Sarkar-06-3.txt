OBJECTIVE/DESCRIPTION:

Compiler Theory is an Area II course in Computing Systems.  Algorithms used
in building a compiler and their underlying foundations from formal
language theory will be covered.  We will cover each component of a
compiler including lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, code
optimization and type checking.  This course will also cover advanced
topics in parsing theory and implementation for arbitrary and deterministic
grammars.  Students will also implement a working compiler for a high level
programming language.

TOPICS:

   o Overview of a compiler
   o Lexical Analysis:  formal language theory:  regular expressions and
     finite-state machines, scanners, symbol tables
   o Simple Parsing:  context-free grammars, derivation trees, ambiguity,
     sentential forms, backtracking parsers, top-down versus bottom-up
     parsing
   o LL(1) parsing:  removing left-recursion, left-factoring, error
     handling
   o Shift-reduce parsers:  handles and handle pruning, shift/reduce
     conflicts
   o SLR/LR parsing:  characteristic automata, action and goto functions,
     viable prefix, introduction to LALR parsing
   o Parsing ambiguous CFGs:  the CKY, Earley and GHR parsing algorithms
     for CFGs, deductive parsing, semiring parsing
   o Type checking:  typing rules, unification, types as inferencing rules,
     attribute grammars
   o Code generation:  generating code from attribute grammars and code
     generation using tree grammars
   o Optimization:  dataflow analysis and global optimization
   o Statistical analysis of programs:  Run-time analysis of parsing,
     probabilistic CFGs
   o Errors in programs:  self correcting parsers

GRADING:

The grade distribution will be handed out at the start of classes.

Students must attain an overall passing grade on the weighted average of
exams in the course in order to obtain a clear pass (C or better).

Academic Honesty plays a key role in our efforts to maintain a high
standard of academic excellence and integrity.  Students are advised that
ALL acts of intellectual dishonesty are subject to disciplinary action by
the School; serious infractions are dealt with in accordance with the Code
of Academic Honesty (T10.02)
(http://www.sfu.ca/policies/teaching/t10-02.htm).  Students are encouraged
to read the School's policy information
